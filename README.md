## :orange_book: Features
+ Using `docker-compose` and recreating a Dockerfile for every service from the oldstable Alpine or Debian version (at the time, <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/">Debian Bookworm</a>)
+ <a href="https://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> container, with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3
+ <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> container, with php-fpm configured and running (files on a volume)
+ <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a> container, with a WordPress database (on a 2nd volume)
+ Linked by a `docker network`

## :cyclone: Clone
Clone the repository and enter it :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sponthus/Inception
cd Inception
```

## 	:runner: Run
From the project directory, use :
```shell
make
```
If you run this for the first time, a script will run to ask informations and login.
A few rules apply :
* The wordpress admin username must not contain "admin" or something similar - ex: "adm-123" ...
* Usernames must not be empty
  
Passwords will be automatically generated and stored in `secrets/` directory.  
Emails will be automatically assumed as `username@42lyon.fr`, as this is a school project. ðŸ‘¼  
Access the website at `localhost`. You will need to accept the certificate because it is auto-signed.  
You can access Wordpress administration using `/wp-admin` and log-in.  

:hugs: Enjoy !
